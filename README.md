In this project a **Movies App** was built by applying the concepts i have learned till now. 
I have created an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a class component, displaying that data, using **component lifecycle** methods, **routing** concepts, **authentication**, and **authorization**, and adding responsiveness to the website.
